# helloGit

Tutorial told me to write something about myself here, but I have no idea what can I write. Sorry, kids.

I just trying to learn Git right now.
I will create new (old) project. I mean, I will upload it to GitHub. So, maybe I will finish it faster. Or rewrite it on Python instead of C++ (QtCreator).
